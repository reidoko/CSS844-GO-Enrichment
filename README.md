# CSS841-GO-Enrichment

#What we will need according to tanghaibao to perform an original ids-to-GOs analysis:
#1: A list of all the genes in one column;
#2: A list of all the genes in the genome of interest in one column;
#3: A data frame with gene names in the first column and GO terms in the second column that are separated by semicolons.

#The find_enrichment.py Python script will run the data for us.
